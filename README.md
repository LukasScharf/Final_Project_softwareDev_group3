## Proposal
###  Objectives:

The objectives for the final projects of this course are primarily to learn and get used to the workflows that are necessary in programming in group projects. Additionally, geo-related analysis with python is the second main focus in this final project.

Regarding the first part, the objectives are to get used to working with **GitHub**, working on different branches and merge the results later on in a main repository. Therefore, a repository has to be set up, that can be cloned of each group member, and where changes can be pushed on. Also, a **python environment**, with all necessary python packages and dependencies, has to be created in order to guarantee that the **Jupyter notebook** works for everyone.

Content and python related, the goal for our final project will be to learn about map visualization, especially using the package ***folium***
The objective is to include the following aspects:
- generating point data of outdoor activity/sport locations
- visualize them with suitable icons
- providing further information in popup windows when clicking on a certain icon

As a second step, a **routing function** should be included. Different options will be considered how to get starting point destination of the route that should be calculated. The following aspects have to be considered and several ideas will be tried out: 
- check out available python packages for routing (first suggestions:  polyline, geopy, openrouteservice, OSMnx) 
- providing a route from a point A to a certain sport location by selecting the destination in the map
(z.B. if clicking on an icon → ask the user: From where to you want to start from? → calculate the route from the user defined coordinates to the sport destination
- starting point A can be either a coordinate input of the user or can be selected on the map as well
